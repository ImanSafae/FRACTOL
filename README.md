# FRACTOL

This program is the 42 school **Fract-ol project**.

Its goal is to use the MinilibX to display the **fractal figures of Mandelbrot and Julia**.

This program allowed me to validate the Fract-ol project with a score of 120/100, with the following bonuses included :

- **Keyboard arrows** allow you to navigate in the window
- **Different color palettes** are available for both fractals
- Zooming in and out will **follow the mouse cursor**
